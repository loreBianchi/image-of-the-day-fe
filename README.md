# 🖼️ Image of the Day - Frontend

Welcome to the Image of the Day gallery! This application is designed to showcase unique, daily art generated entirely by Artificial Intelligence.

## About the Project
This is a live experiment where technology meets news and art. Our goal is to create a dynamic, ephemeral art gallery that changes daily.

How the Art is Created:
1. News Inspiration: Every day, the system fetches a current news headline from a global news feed.
2. AI Art Direction: An internal AI "Art Director" interprets the headline's mood and themes to create a highly descriptive, artistic prompt.
3. Generation: This custom prompt is then fed into a powerful text-to-image AI model, which generates a unique, high-quality digital artwork.

The resulting image is a spontaneous, abstract reflection of the day's global conversation.  

## Features
- Daily Changing Gallery: A new, one-of-a-kind image is published every day.
- Unique Prompts: See the exact artistic prompt used to generate the image, demonstrating the link between news and AI creativity.
- Simple Interface: A clean, fast application built with React and modern web technologies, hosted globally.
